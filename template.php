 * 1. Rename each function and instance of "adaptivetheme_subtheme" to match
 *    your subthemes name, e.g. if your theme name is "footheme" then the function
 *    name will be "footheme_preprocess_hook". Tip - you can search/replace
 *    on "adaptivetheme_subtheme".
 * 2. Uncomment the required function to use.
 * 3. Read carefully, especially within adaptivetheme_subtheme_preprocess_html(), there
 *    are extra goodies you might want to leverage such as a very simple way of adding
 *    stylesheets for Internet Explorer and a browser detection script to add body classes.
