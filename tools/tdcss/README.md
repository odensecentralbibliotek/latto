tdcss.js - Test-driven CSS development
================
(well, sort of anyway ...)
---

A very small framework for structured/TDD-style HTML/CSS development.

Write solid and reusable code by styling design elements in isolation.

What's the benefit
---
tdcss.js was inspired by the modular approach of Object-oriented CSS (<http://oocss.org>) and SMACSS (<http://smacss.com>).

It's especially well suited for using these techniques to model up style tiles (<http://styletil.es/>) in frontend code.


How to use
---

In the header, insert a reference to jQuery and tdcss.js, then apply $.tdcss() on the container holding your fragments:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/tdcss.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
     $(function(){
         $("#my-fragments").tdcss();
     })
</script>
```

Also, you need to reference the stylesheet(s) that you will be testing:
```html
<!-- Project CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="demo/style.css" type="text/css" media="screen">
```

Inside a div with the id #tdcss, insert an html comment with the text ":" to denote a fragment:
```html
<!-- : -->
```

The first text after the prefix becomes the title of the fragment:
```html
<!-- : Element title -->
```

You can fix the height of the fragment container by appending a CSS height value after a semicolon.
This is useful for position:absolute type layouts that don't by themselfes force the container to expand:
```html
<!-- : Element title; 400px -->
```

You can order your fragments into sections by inserting a section comment:
```html
<!-- # Section name -->
```

You can customize the syntax by passing a settings object to $.tdcss():
```javascript
$("#my-fragments").tdcss({
	section_identifier: "#",
	fragment_identifier: ":",
	fragment_info_splitter: ";"
});
```

Here's the markup that produces the screenshot below:
```html
<div id="my-fragments">

	<!-- : Demo element -->
	<div class="some-structure">
	    <p>This is a demo element.</p>
	</div>

	<!-- : Another demo element -->
	<a href="#">This is a demo link.</a>



	<!-- # Typography -->

	<!-- : H1 -->
	<h1>This is a test.</h1>

	<!-- : H2 -->
	<h2>This is a test.</h2>

	<!-- : H3 -->
	<h3>This is a test.</h3>



	<!-- # Custom height -->

	<!-- : Some element that needs a lot of space; 500px -->
	<h3>This is a test.</h3>

</div>
```

tdcss.js will interpret the comments and present your design elements in a nice, structured way.
The point is to help you make your design elements context independent.
